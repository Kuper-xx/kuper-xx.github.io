### Introduction

**The emergence of the fifth estate**

The “Fifth Estate” arises from the empowerment of citizens through digital technologies, particularly social networks. Unlike traditional media, which act as intermediaries, digital platforms allow anyone with Internet access to become a sender of content. According to the “Digital 2023” report by We Are Social and Hootsuite, 59.4% of the world's population (approximately 4.76 billion people) use social networks, which is evidence of the reach and influence of these platforms today.

The emergence of the fifth estate has not only complemented but also challenged the hegemony of traditional media. Today, news and events of public interest are often reported first on social networks before being covered by formal media. This has forced news companies to adopt new strategies, such as the integration of digital formats and direct interaction with their audiences.

**Controversy**

However, this adaptation process has not been easy. Competition with user-generated content and the need to stay relevant has led some media to prioritize speed over accuracy, which sometimes contributes to the dissemination of erroneous information.

### Conclusion

The relationship between traditional media and the fifth estate reflects a profound transformation in the way information is produced and consumed in our society. While citizen empowerment through digital platforms has democratized access to information and facilitated social mobilization, it has also introduced significant challenges, such as misinformation, polarization and algorithmic manipulation.

It is essential that both traditional media and digital citizens assume a shared responsibility in building a truthful and ethical information ecosystem. Only through a collective commitment can we ensure that the fifth estate is a positive force for society, promoting dialogue, truth and understanding in the digital age.
