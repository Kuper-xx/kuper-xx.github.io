Hello, my nickname is `Kuper-xx` on GitHub, and on other social media, it's `kuper_xx`, I'm from Argentina. I consider myself a tech-enthusiast. I love programming, for example: Python, JS, CSS, PHP, Ruby, C++, and other languages like Bash, Batch. I think this expresses a likely desire for automation with symbols, which makes it easy to see why I like data science and hacking, the description of information, and control over it.

I also consider myself a tech-optimist, so I also love Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. I think this is a path to the future. I don't know if it's for day-to-day usage, but yes to change things in the future, no matter what.

This is a webpage to post some random stuff that I consider useful, or just because I want to post things.
